## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Examples:**
```
Add support for LightGBM model
Fix backtest engine commission calculation
Update README with new examples
Refactor feature engineering module
```

### Python Style Guide

This project follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide with some exceptions:

* **Line length**: Maximum 100 characters (instead of 79)
* **Formatting**: Use `black` for automatic code formatting
* **Import ordering**: Use `isort` for import organization
* **Type hints**: Add type hints to all function signatures
* **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings

**Example:**

```python
def calculate_returns(
    prices: pd.Series,
    period: int = 1,
    method: str = "simple"
) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculate returns for a given price series.
    
    Args:
        prices: Series of prices
        period: Number of periods for return calculation
        method: Type of return ('simple' or 'log')
        
    Returns:
        Series of calculated returns
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If method is not 'simple' or 'log'
        
    Example:
        >>> prices = pd.Series([100, 105, 103, 108])
        >>> returns = calculate_returns(prices, period=1)
    """
    if method == "simple":
        return prices.pct_change(period)
    elif method == "log":
        return np.log(prices / prices.shift(period))
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown method: {method}")
```

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use **Markdown** for documentation files
* Include **code examples** where appropriate
* Add **diagrams** for complex concepts
* Keep documentation **up-to-date** with code changes
* Use **clear headings** and **table of contents** for long documents

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/galafis/python-ml-trading-strategies.git
   cd python-ml-trading-strategies
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Install in development mode with dev dependencies
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks (recommended):**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. pytest --cov=src tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. pytest tests/test_ml_models.py -v

# Run specific test
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. pytest tests/test_ml_models.py::test_trading_model_fit_predict -v
```

### Writing Tests

* **Test coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage
* **Test naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `test_calculate_rsi_with_valid_input`)
* **Test organization**: Group related tests in the same file
* **Use fixtures**: Create reusable test data with pytest fixtures
* **Test edge cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error cases

**Example Test:**

```python
import pytest
import pandas as pd
from src.features.technical_indicators import TechnicalIndicators

@pytest.fixture
def sample_prices():
    """Create sample price data for testing"""
    return pd.Series([100, 102, 101, 103, 105, 104, 106])

def test_calculate_sma_valid_input(sample_prices):
    """Test SMA calculation with valid input"""
    sma = TechnicalIndicators.calculate_sma(sample_prices, period=3)
    assert isinstance(sma, pd.Series)
    assert len(sma) == len(sample_prices)
    assert not pd.isna(sma.iloc[2])  # First valid value at index 2

def test_calculate_sma_invalid_period(sample_prices):
    """Test SMA calculation with invalid period"""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        TechnicalIndicators.calculate_sma(sample_prices, period=-1)
```

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting a pull request, run these checks:

```bash
# Format code with black
black src/ tests/ examples/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/ examples/

# Run linter
flake8 src/ tests/ examples/

# Type checking (optional but recommended)
mypy src/
```
